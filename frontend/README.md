# Train Controller
Control your Lego Powered Up Trains from your PC! You can even do so with a gamepad (or more than one!)
## Features
- **Control speed and Light**
- **Gamepad Support**: use your XBox Gamepad to drive your trains
- **Control multiple trains at the same time**: When using a Gamepad, you can select multiple trains to control at once
- **Multiplayer**: Use multiple controllers at the same time to control different trains

## How to use
- Download and run the [latest Release](https://github.com/ronnyporsch/TrainController/releases/latest)
- Run TrainController.exe in the root dir
- (Optional) Connect up to four Gamepads
- Turn on your Lego Trains
- Enjoy!

## Limitations
- Windows only
- This program only works with the Lego City Hubs (found for example in the current [Passenger](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/express-passenger-train-60337) and [Freight Trains](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/freight-train-60336) )
- The program expects the Motor to be on Port A of the train hub, the light (if available on Port B)
- Gamepad Support was only tested with Xbox One Gamepads. Others may or may not work properly

## Roadmap
- Include Android support
- Include Browser support
